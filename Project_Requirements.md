### **Requirements Template with MoSCoW Method**
## Project: Goods Warehouse Localization and Traceability System**
**Must Have Requirements:**

1. The system must allow precise geolocation of boxes and pallets within the goods warehouse.

> - Proximity sensors and Bluetooth technology will be used to achieve the required accuracy.

2. The system must be capable of tracking the location of individual products within boxes and pallets.

> - An RFID-based solution will be implemented to achieve product traceability.

3. The user interface of the system must be intuitive and user-friendly for warehouse personnel.

> - Usability testing and user-centered design principles will be applied.

**Should Have Requirements:**

1. The system should provide real-time alerts and notifications for products nearing their expiration date.

> - A notification module will be developed to alert about approaching expiry dates.

2. The system should be compatible with mobile devices to facilitate the mobility of warehouse personnel.

> - A mobile application will be implemented to access the system from smartphones and tablets.

**Could Have Requirements:**

1. The system could offer augmented reality functionality to guide personnel to the exact location of products in the warehouse.

> - The possibility of integrating augmented reality technology will be explored to enhance the user experience.

2. The system could include a data analysis module to identify storage patterns and optimize product arrangement in the warehouse.

> - Data analysis tools will be evaluated to implement this functionality.

**Won't Have Requirements:**

1. The system will not include facial recognition or biometric identification features for warehouse access.

> - The priority is to maintain the security and privacy of workers' data.

2. The system will not have an invoicing or payment handling function.

> - The focus will remain on goods localization and traceability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The project will be developed using the Python programming language and will be hosted on a local server within the warehouse.

- Close collaboration with warehouse personnel will be maintained to validate requirements and ensure that the system meets their operational needs.
